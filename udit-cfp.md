# UDIT 2022 Call for Papers

UDIT (The Norwegian Conference on Didactics in IT education) is a 
meeting place for scientific publication, discussion, and exchange of 
experiences related to teaching ICT in higher education. We welcome 
contributions on all topics related to education, teaching, didactics 
and the use of ICT in learning. If you have gained new insights and 
good ideas through your work on developing a course ir academic 
progran, UDIT can be an excellent arena for presenting and publishing 
your work.

UDIT accepts contributions in the form of research papers, which will 
be peer reviewed and give credits as publications with ISSN (level 1 in 
the Norwegian publication system, Cristin) and lightning talks, which 
do not give publication credits but serve as valuable contributions to 
the discussions during the conference.

## Research papers

Research papers submitted to UDIT are subject to peer review by at least three independent reviewers. In assessing the papers we consider the following five aspects:

+ Relevance for the conference
+ Potential to stimulate discussion on teaching and learning
+ Importance
    - Does the paper bring new knowledge to the field?
    - Does the paper deal with important issues in IT or society more broadly?
    - Can the results be generalized? How useful are the results for teachers of other courses at other universities?
+ Scientific quality
    - Are the goals and research questions clearly stated?
    - Are the methods clearly discussed?
    - Are the results clearly stated and well supported by the data and methods used?
    - Are the conclusions clear?
    - Are the references adequate and relevant?
+ Presentation
    - How readable is the paper? How well structured is it?
    - Does the title and abstract reflect the contents of the paper?
    - Is the paper formatted correctly according to the NIKT template, and does the paper stay within the page limit?

Research papers accepted at UDIT will be published as part of the 
conference reports from the NIKT series (e-ISSN 1892-0721). This series 
is published by Bibsys Open Journal Systems and gives level 1 credits 
in the Cristin system.

It is not required that the submission be anonymous, but you may choose 
to submit anonymously. Deadlines for submitting (mandatory) abstract 
and research papers can be found on the main NIKT page.

## Lightning talks

If you have an idea or some experiences with teaching methods and tools 
for ICT-education, but do not have a full-fledged scientific paper on 
it, a lightning talk is a good way to present it and have a discussion 
on it. A lightning talk is a 5-minute presentation, with a one-page 
abstract published in a separate part of the conference proceedings. 
The deadline for submitting lightning talks is the same as for the 
posters of other NIKT tracks. A lightning talk will be reviewed by the 
program committee mostly based on relevance and potential to stimulate 
discussion on teaching and learning.

## Assessment and publication

Contributions to UDIT may be written in Norwegian, another Scandinavian 
language, or English. Presentations should be given in English if part 
of the audience at the conference does not speak a Scandinavian 
language.

All contributions have to be original and not be published or under 
review elsewhere.

Authors retain the rights to further developing their contribution for 
other publishing channels.

We have the following requirements for publication in the conference 
report, both for research papers and for extended abstracts for 
posters/demonstrations:

+ The required documents must be submitted within the given deadlines
+ At least one author must register for the conference and present the work at the conference

Under specific circumstances, a submitted manuscript can be refused by 
the program committee without being sent for peer review. This applies 
if the manuscript has obvious deficiencies, making peer review 
meaningless (i.e., plagiarism, the work has been presented elsewhere, 
no scientific contents of a topic far outside of the area of UDIT). In 
cases of plagiarism or scientific dishonesty (i.e., plagiarism or 
auto-generated gibberish), the rejection and its reason will not only 
be sent to the submitter, but also, potentially, to the institution 
where (s)he is employed, and also to those being plagiarized.

## Format and submission

All contributions to UDIT should be submitted via EasyChair: 
[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=udit2022]()

Submitted papers must be formatted according to LNCS Springer Computer Science Proceedings style:
[https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines]()

The page limit is 14 pages (including references).
