# UDIT 2022 Call for Papers

UDIT (The Norwegian Conference on Didactics in IT education) is a 
meeting place for scientific publication, discussion, and exchange of 
experiences related to teaching ICT in higher education. We welcome 
contributions on all topics related to education, teaching, didactics 
and the use of ICT in learning. If you have gained new insights and 
good ideas through your work on developing a course ir academic 
progran, UDIT can be an excellent arena for presenting and publishing 
your work.

UDIT invites the submission of research papers, which will be peer reviewed.
Accepted research papers accepted at UDIT will be published as part of the 
conference reports from the NIKT series (e-ISSN 1892-0721). This series 
is published by Bibsys Open Journal Systems and gives level 1 credits 
in the Cristin system.

It will also be possible to propose presentations based on abstract only.
Abstracts will not be peer reviewed, but selected by the programme comittee
based on their relevance and potential to generate fruitful discussion.
Such abstract-only presentations are appropriate both for *work in progress*,
and for *challenges* where the author invites input to concrete problems
in their own teaching or educational design.
