# UDIT 2022 First Call for Papers

UDIT (The Norwegian Conference on Didactics in IT education) is a 
meeting place for scientific publication, discussion, and exchange of 
experiences related to teaching ICT in higher education. We welcome 
contributions on all topics related to education, teaching, didactics,
and the use of ICT in learning. If you have gained new insights and 
good ideas through your work on developing a course or academic 
programme, UDIT can be an excellent arena for presenting and publishing 
your work.  It is a scholarly conference, but the perspective is that
of the practioner more than that of the research discipline of pedagogy.

UDIT invites the submission of research papers, which will be peer reviewed.
Accepted papers will be published as part of the conference reports from
the NIKT series (e-ISSN 1892-0721), which is accredited at Level 1 i Norway. 
Last year's UDIT papers can be found at
[https://ojs.bibsys.no/index.php/NIK/issue/view/87](https://ojs.bibsys.no/index.php/NIK/issue/view/87)

It will also be possible to propose presentations based on abstract only.
Abstracts will not be peer reviewed, but selected by the programme comittee
based on their relevance and potential to generate fruitful discussion.
Such abstract-only presentations are appropriate both for *work in progress*,
and for *challenges* where the author invites input to concrete problems
in their own teaching or educational design.
Abstracts accepted this year are particularly welcome as full papers next
year.

## Research papers

Research papers submitted to UDIT are subject to peer review by at least
two independent reviewers.
Education and didactics is a broad disciplines, and we recognise that
papers may be written in any of a range of genres, using methodologies
from social, human, or natural sciences.
Whatever the genre, we require a solid, scholarly standard, and the
peer reviewers will use the following five criteria in the assessment.

+ Relevance for the conference
+ Potential to stimulate discussion on teaching and learning
+ Importance
    - Does the paper bring new knowledge to the community?
    - Does the paper deal with important issues in IT education or society more broadly?
    - Can the results be generalised? 
      How useful are the results for teachers of other courses at other universities?
+ Scholarly quality
    - Are the goals and research questions clearly stated?
    - Are the methods clearly stated?
    - Are the results clearly formulated and justified in light of existing literature
      and/or empirical results?
    - Are the conclusions clear?
    - Are the references adequate and relevant?
+ Presentation
    - How readable is the paper? How well structured is it?
    - Does the title and abstract reflect the contents of the paper?
    - Is the paper formatted correctly according to the NIKT template, and does the paper stay within the page limit?
